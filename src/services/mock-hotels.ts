The taxis that bear the Nikko name were always on hand and good operators (cheap to get around). The bar had a fantastic happy hour being good nibbles and great value. We were always being helped by the concierge operators when coming and going and always translated for us to the taxi drivers. One of my best hotels.",

        content: "Disappointing stay as the condition of the hotel was the exact opposite of hotel nikko in saigon- Do not eat the food in this hotel, it is not only overprized but it also lacks in freshness and quality. The pool and fitness area looked alrite. The staff was helpful. The bar only offered one type of wine by the glass. We saw a bottle of wine called 'Apothic Red' which cost $12 in Aspen, CO in a bottle shop and about $30 in an expensive restaurant in Aspen. The hotel offered this inexpensive wine for &100?? We had a laugh and ended up having a drink in a different hotel. I would highly recommend hotel nikko in Saigon BUT not in hanoi",
